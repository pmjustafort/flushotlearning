    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Vaccines have long been a cornerstone of public health, shielding individuals and entire communities from a wide array of infectious diseases. Among these, the ongoing efforts to immunize against seasonal influenza stand out as a vital and complex undertaking. Unlike specific pandemic strains such as the 2009 H1N1 \"swine flu,\" seasonal flu is a persistent and annually recurring challenge, necessitating vigilance and adaptation by medical professionals every year. Seasonal influenza vaccines are developed and distributed on an annual basis to combat the most common flu strains predicted to circulate during the upcoming flu season. Scientists and researchers analyze global flu trends, collecting samples and data to determine which strains are most likely to pose a threat. The composition of the seasonal flu vaccine is then tailored each year based on these predictions, making it a unique and dynamic tool in the fight against influenza.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, a coordinated effort involving the government, healthcare providers, public health organizations, and even private companies is launched each year to promote and provide seasonal flu vaccines. This expansive campaign includes public education, accessibility initiatives, and collaboration with healthcare professionals to ensure that vaccines reach as many people as possible. Guiding these efforts are robust data collection and analysis, including surveys and studies that closely monitor vaccination rates. One such resource is the National Seasonal Flu Survey, a comprehensive effort to gather information about individuals' vaccination status, as well as insights into their lives, opinions, and behaviors related to vaccination. In this analysis, we will delve into the data from this survey, applying statistical and analytical techniques to uncover patterns and trends in seasonal flu vaccination. By understanding the factors that influence people's decisions to get vaccinated, such as age, location, education, and beliefs about vaccines, we can craft targeted strategies to increase vaccination rates."

    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset utilized in this project originates from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS), conducted during the 2009-10 flu season. This telephone survey was designed to monitor influenza immunization coverage in the United States, specifically targeting individuals aged 6 months or older. A collaboration between the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the NHFS collected information from October 2009 to June 2010. Its primary focus was to produce timely estimates of vaccination coverage rates for both the monovalent pH1N1 and trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines during the 2009-2010 flu season in response to the H1N1 pandemic. The CDC continues to monitor seasonal flu vaccination through other ongoing annual phone surveys, but the NHFS stands as a one-time survey created for this specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our exploration we're given three CSV's:\n",
    "1. **Training Labels**: This one holds the binary labels we'll be training our model(s) to predict. There are two target labels, `'h1n1_vaccine'` and '`seasonal_vaccine'`— for this analysis we're only concerned with the latter. A $0$ indicates that the given respondent did not receive the respective vaccine while a $1$ indicates that the given respondent received the respective vaccine. This file shares the `'respondent_id'` column with the Training Features CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Features**: These are the features we'll be using to predict the probability of a respondent receiving a vaccine. There are 35 features and each is a response to a survey question. Features comprise various topics, such as behavioral (whether a respondent touches their face, washes their hand, etc.), opinion (whether the respondent believed the h1n1 vaccine was effective, etc.), and demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing Features**: These features relate to the respondents for whom we will be predicting the likelihood of receiving the vaccine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go ahead and import the necessary imports and load in our data so that we can start cleaning it."
